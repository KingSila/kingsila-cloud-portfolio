      "A green Terraform apply from CI is the best confirmation that identity, RBAC, and remote state are correctly wired together"
    ],
    "notes": "Today focused on fixing Key Vault access for Terraform running in GitHub Actions. By enabling RBAC mode on the vault, assigning a data-plane role to the CI service principal, and wiring the correct object ID into Terraform variables, the dev environment apply now completes successfully with secrets managed in Key Vault. This solidifies the RBAC and CI foundation for rolling the same pattern into test and prod."
