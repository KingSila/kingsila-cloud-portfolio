# 📊 Project Progress Tracker (Aligned to Real Work – 2025-12-09)

## 🎯 Overall Project Progress
**Current Progress:** **60%**
*(Previously 45–55%, increased after aligning completed work in Weeks 3–6.)*

Your actual engineering work is far ahead of the original linear curriculum, especially in:
- identity + Key Vault patterns
- RBAC cleanup
- tfsec + policy scanning
- policy-as-code modules
- environment stability
- secret automation end-to-end
- App Service integration + telemetry

Those are *major milestone items* normally spread across Weeks 2–8.
